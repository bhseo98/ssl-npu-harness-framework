"""NPU Harness Framework — modality-agnostic evaluation harness core.

The framework primitives: a config-driven registry for swapping stage
implementations, a per-stage profiler (latency / RAM / GPU), a marker ABC
for stages, and a linear Pipeline that chains stages with profiler
measurement.

Concrete plugins (voice STT/LLM/TTS, vision classifier, ...) live on
separate branches — see the `voice-app` branch for the first application
example. Design intent and the Phase A/B/C generalization path live in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
